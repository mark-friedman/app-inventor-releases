Google and MIT are pleased to announce the initial free and open-source release from Google of the App Inventor source code

There's currently little supporting documentation yet, and we’re not accepting contributions to the code right now.  That will happen later, after the MIT Center for Mobile Learning opens their App Inventor server to the public.  We hope to nurture a robust and active open-source project eventually, but for now we don't want to distract the MIT developers from their efforts to complete and deploy the large-scale public server.  In the meantime, we’ll update the code periodically to match what’s running at the latest MIT experimental system.  We've also created a Google Group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/app-inventor-open-source-dev) for people working with the code to relate their experiences with the code, ask questions, help each other, etc.

People who create modifications from this code base are free to use the term “App Inventor” and the puzzle-piece Android logo in their work.   MIT will be releasing its own versions under the name “MIT App Inventor”, which is reserved for the systems actually coming from MIT.

Please note that at the current time, the App Inventor build server (part of this code release) only works on Linux and Mac operating systems.

See SourceMap for a high level description of the various source directories.

See BuildingAndRunning to get started building and running App Inventor from this code.

Enjoy the code, and Happy Inventing!
